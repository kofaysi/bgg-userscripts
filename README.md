## Scripts

### BBCode Shortcuts, Link Inserter and Image Upload Assistant

This single userscript enhances your text editing experience on BoardGameGeek by adding keyboard shortcuts for BBCode formatting, automating link and image insertion, and simplifying image uploads. Key features include:

1. **BBCode Formatting Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quickly format text with keyboard shortcuts for bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, typewriter, headings, quotes, and hidden text.
2. **One-Click Embedding**:
   - **Automated Link Insertion**: Detects URLs pasted into the text field, opens the link dialog, and completes the link insertion for you.
   - **Smart Image Handling**: Detects BoardGameGeek image URLs, opens the image dialog, extracts the image ID, sets the preferred image size, and embeds the image seamlessly.
3. **Image Upload Assistant**:
   - **Automatic Upload Tab Selection**: Directly opens the image upload section.
   - **Drag-and-Drop Upload**: Automatically fills the upload path; simply drop your image.
   - **Filename Handling**: Inputs the filename into the text area automatically. Double-click the text area to edit as needed.
   - **Subscribe Checkbox**: Automatically checks the subscribe box to keep you updated on image posts.
   - **Preferred Image Size Selection**: Sets medium size for optimal display.

### Video Resizer
This userscript resizes BGG videos to not be the full width of the column and maintains proper aspect ratio and alignment. Here’s what it does:

1. **Resize YouTube Video Elements**: Adjusts the width and height of YouTube videos.
2. **Adjust Parent Containers**: Ensures no overflow and proper alignment of video containers.

### Add Edit Tags Link
  
This userscript enhances the user experience on the BoardGameGeek website by automatically adding an "Edit Tags" link to each board game entry listed on pages under https://boardgamegeek.com/tag/*. The "Edit Tags" link is seamlessly integrated into the existing layout, aligning to the right within the row of the board game name. This allows users to quickly access the tag editing page for any board game without disrupting the visual style of the site. The script runs automatically upon page load, requiring no additional interaction from the user.

### BGG Simplify Mark Read Button

This userscript streamlines the **Subscriptions** page on [BoardGameGeek Subscription page](https://boardgamegeek.com/subscriptions) by replacing the dropdown-based **"Mark All Read"** button with a more direct and user-friendly **"Mark Current Page Read"** button.

#### Key Features:
- 🧼 **Clean Interface**: Hides the dropdown menu and its surrounding container.
- 🖱️ **Direct Access**: Replaces the two-click "Mark All Read" interaction with a one-click button that marks only the current page as read.
- 🎨 **Improved Visuals**: Applies a consistent blue button style for better visibility and UI harmony.
- 🔄 **Dynamic Support**: Automatically adapts to dynamically loaded content using a MutationObserver.

#### Why Use It?
The original "Mark All Read" button presents a risk of clearing everything unintentionally. This script reduces that risk and makes the interface more efficient for daily use.

## How to Install

### Prerequisites
- **Tampermonkey** (or any other userscript manager) installed in your browser.
